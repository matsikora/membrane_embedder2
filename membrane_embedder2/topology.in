Cutoff: 0.1 
#Placement: random # grid, coordinates
#Placement: coordinates # grid, coordinates
Placement: grid # grid, coordinates
# Need to also add options to:
# 1. Add an additional bead(s)
#    define attachment point
#    either define position (absolute - for membrane) or let it be constructed (glycan)
#    define spring constant
#    define restraints - this could be connected to membrane making.
# 2. define break points where hinge is added
# Small additions should be possible via "addon keyword, 
#large ones should be added via "connect_to" keyword followed by name 
#of molecule to connect to. Then topology should be able to 
#traverse the graph and define domains by that.
