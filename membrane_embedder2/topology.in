# Cutoff for molecule placement. Set to 0 if Complexes should deal wiht it
Cutoff: 0.1 
#Placement: random # grid, coordinates
#Placement: coordinates # grid, coordinates
Placement: grid # grid, coordinates
# Need to also add options to:
# 1. Add an additional bead(s)
#    define attachment point
#    either define position (absolute - for membrane) or let it be constructed (glycan)
#    define spring constant
#    define restraints - this could be connected to membrane making.
# 2. define break points where hinge is added
#Addon: {name: link1, attachment:position: }
